## Research and Reflections

I use this section to capture practical lessons from projects, research, and toolchain testing.
Future topics:
- Threat modeling for small utilities
- Automating compliance reporting
- Integrating SOAR tools with GitOps pipelines
- Mapping Wiz and Splunk findings to NIST CSF 2.0 categories
